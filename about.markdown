#### Hi, this is Hao Lin, a passionate guy with curiosity & love!

# 🎓 Education & Career

I am pursuing my master of science degree in computer science (MSCS) at the 🇺🇸 University of Wisconsin–Madison (◍•ᴗ•◍)

Prior to that, I earned my B.Eng. in electrical and computer engineering (ECE), with 🌟 honors research program, and a minor degree in data science (DS) at the 🇨🇳 Shanghai Jiao Tong University (UM-SJTU Joint Institute 上交密院).

Following my bachelor's, I worked at 💙 ByteDance for a year as an SDE, and then took a gap year.

I love computer science & engineering (CSE) since childhood. Before college, I founded a computer & electronics social club, won algorithm contests, and DIY software & hardware.
